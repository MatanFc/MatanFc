# Hello, I'm Matan!

I'm an experienced software developer with five years of expertise in the field. Currently, I'm also pursuing my passion as an AI researcher, exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share my journey in software development and AI. Join me on this exciting adventure!


## About Me

I'm Matan, a software developer with a passion for creating desktop applications, web apps, and Telegram bots. Over the years, I have honed my skills in these areas, delivering high-quality solutions. Recently, my focus has shifted towards exploring the fascinating world of AI models, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Apart from coding, I have a strong interest in martial arts and actively participate in various disciplines. Sports, especially martial arts, provide me with the discipline, focus, and resilience that I apply to my coding projects as well.

I'm excited to share my projects and continue learning and growing in both software development and AI. Let's connect and collaborate on this journey!
